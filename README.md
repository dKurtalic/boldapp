The inspiration behind the "StartApp" application stems from my participation in the BOLD Fellowship Program for Entrepreneurship in New York, USA. As a member of the BOLD Cohort, our collective objective is to enhance the entrepreneurship ecosystem in Bosnia and Herzegovina. To contribute towards this goal, I am currently developing a web application that seeks to facilitate connections between founders and potential teammates with specific skillsets. By simplifying the process of finding co-founders and stakeholders, the aim is to enable easier collaboration and foster the growth of innovative ventures in the region.
